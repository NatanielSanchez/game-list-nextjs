# The Game List

Simple website for browsing videogames, powered by IGDB database, and add them to a personal track played, completed, dropped, or plan-to-play games.
Made with NextJS, AuthJS, Supabase and Tanstack Query, styled with SCSS modules. Deployed to Vercel [here](https://game-list-nextjs.vercel.app/).
